# Love2Dev
Love2Dev is an editor built on top of my LuaEdit project with the sole purpose of creating love2d (LÖVE) games.

Note: You need to install the LÖVE app to run your lua projects.

## Creating a new LÖVE project
- Go to the file manager in the app.
- Create or select your project directory (e.g. love2d)
- Create your main.lua file
- Set the current directory as your project/build path (refer to running a LÖVE project below).
- Open main.lua and click the play/run button to test if it works.

## Running a LÖVE project
- Click the file icon on the top left of the editor and go to your project path.
- Click the icon on the top right to set the path as the build path.
- Go back to the editor and click run!

Note: For now, this app can only run uncompressed LÖVE projects and will support .love files in the future. **Happy Coding!**
